\title{Calculate splicing diversity changes between two conditions.}
\usage{
calculate_fc(x, samples, control, method = "mean", pseudocount = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{matrix} with the splicing diversity values.}

\item{samples}{Character vector with an equal length to the number of columns
in the input dataset, specifying the category of each sample.}

\item{control}{Name of the control sample category, defined in the
\code{samples} vector, e.g. \code{control = 'Normal'} or \code{control =
'WT'}.}

\item{method}{Method to use for calculating the average splicing diversity
value in a condition. Can be \code{'mean'} or \code{'median'}.}

\item{pseudocount}{Numeric scalar. Small value added to non-positive
observed group summaries to avoid zeros when computing differences and
log2 fold-changes. If \code{pseudocount = 0} (default) the function will
choose a small value equal to half the smallest positive observed value,
or \code{1e-6} if no positive values are present. Rows with insufficient
observations remain \code{NA} and are not imputed.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with mean or median value of splicing diversity
across sample categories, the difference between these values and the log2
fold change values.
}
\description{
Calculate splicing diversity changes between two conditions.
}
\details{
The function uses a matrix of splicing diversity values in order to
calculate mean or median differences and log2 fold changes between two
conditions.
